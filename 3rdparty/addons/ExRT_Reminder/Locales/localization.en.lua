|cffffff00R|r before a condition inverts the order of the list when checking the condition, R1 - last player in the list, R1/3 - last third of the list

|cffffff00x|r - only the player at position x in the list passes the check
|cffffff00x%y|r - every y, starting from x, e.g., 2%3 - 2, 5, 8, 11, etc.
|cffffff00x-y|r - range of players, if the player is in the list between x and y, they pass, e.g., 2-4 - 2, 3, 4
|cffffff00x/y|r - the list is divided into y parts, the condition passes if the player is in part x. If it is not possible to divide evenly, the first parts will be larger than the last. For example, if a list of 10 players is divided into 3 parts, it will be 4, 3, 3, i.e., 1-4, 5-7, 8-10

|cffffff00<=x|r - player's position is less than or equal to x
|cffffff00<x|r - player's position is less than x

|cff80ff00Guide to Conditions|r

Numeric Conditions - Counter, Percentage, Stacks
    Numeric conditions are not case-sensitive, separated by commas ,
    Operators:
    |cffffff00!x|r    - excluding x
    |cffffff00>=x|r   - greater than or equal to x
    |cffffff00>x|r    - greater than x
    |cffffff00<=x|r   - less than or equal to x
    |cffffff00<x|r    - less than x
    |cffffff00=x|r    - equal to x
    |cffffff00x%y|r   - every y, starting from x
    |cffffff00+|r     - complement to the previous condition

    Example Condition 1: |cff00ff001, 3, 4|r
    This example will trigger on casts 1, 3, 4.

    Example Condition 2: |cff00ff00>=2, +!6, +!7|r
    |cffffff00If mathematical equations are present in the condition, subsequent conditions
    should be complemented with '+' as in the example.|r

    This example implies greater than or equal to 2, but excluding 6 and 7,
    it will trigger on casts 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and so on.

    Example Condition 3: |cff00ff003%5|r
    This example implies every 5th cast starting from 3, it will trigger on casts 3, 8, 13, 18, and so on.


String Conditions - Source Name, Target Name
    String conditions are case-sensitive, separated by semicolons ;
    Operators:
    |cffffff00-|r    - excluding all matches

    Example Condition 1: |cff00ff00Scalecommander Sarkareth|r
    This example implies that the unit should be "Scalecommander Sarkareth".

    Example Condition 2: |cff00ff00-Scalecommander Sarkareth;Empty Recollection|r
    This example excludes "Scalecommander Sarkareth" and excludes "Empty Recollection".

    Example Condition 3: |cff00ff00Scalecommander Sarkareth;Empty Recollection|r
    This example implies that the unit should be either "Scalecommander Sarkareth"
    or "Empty Recollection".


MobID Conditions - Source ID, Target ID
    MobID conditions are case-sensitive, separated by commas ,
    Operators:
    |cffffff00x:y|r   - where x is the npcID, and y is the spawnIndex

    Example Condition 1: |cff00ff00154131,234156|r
    This example implies that the npcID should be 154131 or 234156.

    Example Condition 2: |cff00ff00154131:1,234156:2|r
    This example implies that the npcID should be 154131 with spawnIndex 1 or 234156 with spawnIndex 2.

|cff80ff00Guide to Counter Types|r

    |cff00ff00Default|r - Adds +1 with each trigger activation.

    |cff00ff00Per Source|r - Adds +1 with each trigger activation. Separate counter for each caster.

    |cff00ff00Per Target|r - Adds +1 with each trigger activation. Separate counter for each target.

    |cff00ff00Trigger Overlap|r - Adds +1 when the trigger activates while
    all other triggers are active.

    |cff00ff00Trigger Overlap with Reset|r - Adds +1 when the trigger activates while
    all other triggers are active. Resets the counter to 0 when the reminder deactivates.

    |cff00ff00Shared for This Reminder|r - Adds +1 with each trigger activation.
    Shared counter with every trigger of the same counter type in this reminder.

    |cff00ff00Reset After 5 Seconds|r - Adds +1 with each trigger activation.
    Resets the counter to 0 after 5 seconds from each trigger activation.

|cff80ff00Guide to Loading Conditions Logic|r

    Loading can be based on the following conditions: Class, Role, Group Number, Nickname, and by Note.
    At least one match must be found within each condition.

    For example, loading for the classes Warrior and Paladin:
        - If a player is a Warrior or Paladin, the reminder will be loaded.

    When using multiple loading conditions, the reminder will be loaded
    only if all conditions are met.

    For example, loading for the classes Warrior, Paladin, and the role Tank:
        - If a player is a Warrior or Paladin and is a Tank, the reminder will be loaded.
        - If a player is a Warrior or Paladin but not a Tank, the reminder will not be loaded.


|cff80ff00Guide to Loading by Note|r

    In the Loading Conditions section, you can specify a note template. By default, the reminder
    will look for a note line that begins with the specified template, and the reminder will be loaded
    for all players in this line.

    You can check the |cffffff00Note is a Block|r option, and then the search will be conducted
    within the block from patStart to patEnd.

    Example of a block:

        liquidStart
        Mishok Ambi
        Powel Kroifel
        Nimb Loves
        liquidEnd

    If additional parameters are not specified (see below), the reminder will be loaded for
    all players in the block.

    You can specify additional parameters for loading by note template.

    If you prefix |cffffff00-|r before the template, the loading logic will be inverted.
    That is, the reminder will be loaded for all players who are not found by the template.

    It is also possible to load the reminder only for specific positions in the note. To do this,
    after the template, you need to specify a special parameter |cffffff00{pos:y:x}|r,
    where |cffffff00y|r and |cffffff00x|r are numbers indicating the player's position
    for whom the reminder should be loaded.

    When using the template for a specific line |cffffff00y|r indicates the ordinal number of
    the player in the line.

    When using the template for a block in the note, |cffffff00y|r indicates the ordinal
    number of the line in the block, and |cffffff00x|r indicates the ordinal number
    of the player in the line. |cffffff00x|r can be omitted, then the reminder will
    be loaded for all players in the line |cffffff00y|r.

    If |cffffff00y|r and |cffffff00x|r are not specified (i.e., simply |cffffff00{pos}|r),
    the reminder will be loaded for all players found by the template. However, you can
    use the text replacement template |cffffff00{notepos:y:x}|r, which shows the
    player's nickname in that position, in other parts of the
    reminder (e.g., on-screen message or TTS).

    Without the additional |cffffff00{pos}|r parameter, using this text replacement template will not work.

    The system of note positions is cyclic. For example,
    if there are 5 players in a line, the 6th position will be occupied by the 1st player,
    if there are 8 lines, the 10th position will be occupied by the 2nd line, and so on.

    Examples:

    Note Template:

        #left

    Note:

        #left |cfff48cbaMishoksempai|r |cffa330c9Facemikh|r |cffa330c9Ennueldh|r |cffaad372Friiraan|r

    The reminder will be loaded for all players in the line
    starting with "#left."

    Note Template:

        -#right

    Note:

        #right |cfffff468Kroifel|r |cfffff468Turboclick|r |cff00ff98Nimbmain|r |cffffffffFaitiasd|r

    The reminder will be loaded for all players except
    those in the line starting with "#right."

    Note Template:

        #center {pos:3}

    Note:

        #center |cfff48cbaMishoksempai|r |cffa330c9Facemikh|r |cffa330c9Ennueldh|r |cffaad372Friiraan|r

    The reminder will be loaded only for the 3rd player
    in the note: |cffa330c9Ennueldh|r

    Note Template for a Block:

        roots

    Note:

        rootsStart
        |cffc41e3aRomadesgrip|r
        |cffa330c9Ennueldh|r
        |cfff48cbaMishoksempai|r
        |cffc69b6dSquishexh|r
        |cffaad372Batkito|r
        rootsEnd

    The reminder will be loaded for all players in the note found starting from "rootsStart" to "rootsEnd."

    Note Template for a Block:

        seeds{pos:2}

    Note:

        seedsStart
        |cffc41e3aRomadesgrip|r |cffa330c9Ennueldh|r |cfff48cbaMishoksempai|r |cffc69b6dSquishexh|r |cffaad372Batkito|r
        |cff00ff98Nimbmain|r Omegachka |cffffffffFaitiasd|r |cfff48cbaLoves|r
        seedsEnd

    The reminder will be loaded for all players in the second
    line: |cff00ff98Nimbmain|r Omegachka |cffffffffFaitiasd|r |cfff48cbaLoves|r

    Note Template for a Block:

        seeds{pos:2:3}

    Note:

        seedsStart
        |cffc41e3aRomadesgrip|r |cffa330c9Ennueldh|r |cfff48cbaMishoksempai|r |cffc69b6dSquishexh|r |cffaad372Batkito|r
        |cff00ff98Nimbmain|r Omegachka |cffffffffFaitiasd|r |cfff48cbaLoves|r
        seedsEnd

    The reminder will be loaded only for the 3rd player in the second line: Faitiasd


    Note Template for a Block:

seeds{pos:6}

Note:

seedsStart
|cffc41e3aРомадесгрип|r |cffa330c9Эннуелдх|r |cfff48cbaМишоксемпай|r |cffc69b6dСквишех|r |cffaad372Батькито|r
|cff00ff98Нимбмейн|r Омежечка |cffffffffФейтясд|r |cfff48cbaЛовес|r
seedsEnd

The reminder will be loaded for all players from the second line because of
the cyclic order of positions in the block: 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, etc.


|cFFC69B6DTips on using the addon|r

1. I recommend familiarizing yourself with the functionality of the History window.
   - By clicking on different columns, you can change the reminder settings.
   - For example, if you want to quickly create a reminder for an ability that the boss uses
     during several phases, and the number of casts in each phase depends on the transition timers,
     I recommend the following:

    In the History window, find the desired boss cast in the desired phase and click on the column
    with the tooltip "Time from phase start". This way, the reminder will be immediately set to the
    timer of the selected phase and will set the delay (show after) to the selected value.

2. I do not recommend using timers from |cffff0000BigWigs/DBM|r if you plan to send
   your reminders to other raiders.
   - In BigWigs and DBM, timers often differ, and it is best to avoid such a way of setting up a reminder.
   - The best option would be to set up a reminder based on the last boss cast and count down to the next one.

3. When creating a reminder based on the boss's phase, you also need to be vigilant,
   as phases in |cffff0000BigWigs and DBM|r may differ in numbering or phase start triggers.
   - The situation with phases in boss mods is much more stable than with timers,
     but it is still worth being wary of discrepancies.
   - The best option would be to find out which trigger in one of the addons is set for phase change
     (for example, "Cast Success" or "Aura Applied") and use this trigger as the start of the phase.

4. Points 2 and 3 are not relevant if everyone in your guild uses the same boss mod addon.
